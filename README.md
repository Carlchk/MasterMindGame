### What is Mastermind?

Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. 

The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.

It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called Bulls and Cows that may date back a century or more.
